# Java-Socket-Programming
Simple Example of Single and Multi Client in Java Socket Programing. You can find two folders in this repository namely [SingleClient] and [Other_Client_Socket]. The Other_Client_Socket is where the multi-client socket can be found. 

## Important Notice!!!
This may not be applicable to all. But, I use VSCode to run this code. I'll run you to some basics before running. If you have these following things, you can skip this process and go to [Usage]

- [Difference between **JRE** and **JDK**]
- [Visual Studio Code]
- [Eclipse]
- [Clone Repository]
- [Running the Program]

## Difference between JRE and JDK
**JDK** stands for **Java Develompent Kit**, it is the full-feature SDK for java. It has the everything the JRE has, but also the compiler **"javac"** and tools like **"javadoc"** and **"jdb"**. It is capable of creating and compiling programs.

**JRE** stands for **Java Runtime Edition**. It's a package of everything necessary to run a compiled Java Program, including the **Java Virtual Machine**. The Java Class Library, the java command, and other infrastructure. Although, it cannot be used to create new programs.

## Visual Studio Code
I use Visual Studio Code as my IDE for Java, Python, C, C++, etc. You can download Visual Studio Code [Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Just Choose what Operating System you're at, after choosing there will be a step-by-step installation so be sure to read toroughly.

## Eclipse
For alternative IDE, you can use **Eclipse** which is good for java language. You can download Eclipse [Here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/). For a step-by-step installation you can view their [Eclipse Installer 2022-03 R](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer)

## Clone Repository
You can clone the repository after you have your IDE:
```
https://github.com/Resonanc3/Java-Socket-Programming.git
```
## Running the Program
Please note that I am **Not an Expert Programmer** nor have the capability like other programmer. I'm just merely sharing you the steps on how I execute the program. After downloading or cloning the repository. You can place the folder anywhere, just make sure that your IDE would find the location of the program. For this part, I will show you how I execute the program in **Visual Studio Code** IDE.

**1.**
Make sure that your explorer in **Visual Studio Code** shows the location of where you put the downloaded program. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79844632/164130587-42c218ec-2ce8-431b-b63f-d93aadb5a095.png)
