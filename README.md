# Java-Socket-Programming
Simple Example of Single and Multi Client in Java Socket Programing. You can find two folders in this repository namely [SingleClient] and [Other_Client_Socket]. The Other_Client_Socket is where the multi-client socket can be found. 

## Important Notice!!!
This may not be applicable to all. But, I use VSCode to run this code. I'll run you to some basics before running. If you have these following things, you can skip this process and go to [Usage]

## Difference between JRE and JDK
**JDK** stands for **Java Develompent Kit**, it is the full-feature SDK for java. It has the everything the JRE has, but also the compiler **"javac"** and tools like **"javadoc"** and **"jdb"**. It is capable of creating and compiling programs.

**JRE** stands for **Java Runtime Edition**. It's a package of everything necessary to run a compiled Java Program, including the **Java Virtual Machine**. The Java Class Library, the java command, and other infrastructure. Although, it cannot be used to create new programs.

## Visual Studio Code
I use Visual Studio Code as my IDE for Java, Python, C, C++, etc. You can download Visual Studio Code [Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Just Choose what Operating System you're at, after choosing there will be a step-by-step installation so be sure to read toroughly.

## Eclipse
For alternative IDE, you can use **Eclipse** which is good for java language. You can download Eclipse [Here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/). For a step-by-step installation you can view their [Eclipse Installer 2022-03 R](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer)

## Clone Repository
You can clone the repository after you have your IDE:
```
https://github.com/Resonanc3/Java-Socket-Programming.git
```

## JDK and JRE Version Check
Let's check whether you have installed both JDK and JRE in your computer.

## **1. (JDK and JRE Version Check)** Open CMD, you can either run it with or without administrator. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79844632/164131168-3a2077ff-c0d9-48ef-bdde-08e751278fc1.png)

## **2. (JDK and JRE Version Check)** You can type this following command to check if you have installed the Java Runtime Edition.
```
java --version
```
It should have the following output (in image shown below) if you have installed the JRE properly.

## **3. (JDK and JRE Version Check)** To check whether you installed the Java Development Kit properly, input the following command in the CMD
```
javac --version
```

It should have the following output (in image shown below) if you have installed the JDK properly.

## **4. (JDK and JRE Version Check)** You can also check in its file location to see whether you have both JDK and JRE installed.

Check it for yourself by going to its default location.
```
C:\Program Files\Java
```
if you've installed JDK and JRE but still get an error in inputting the commands from [Step 2](#**2. (JDK and JRE Version Check)**) or [Step 3]

## Running the Program
Please note that I am **Not an Expert Programmer** nor have the capability like other programmer. I'm just merely sharing you the steps on how I execute the program. After downloading or cloning the repository. You can place the folder anywhere, just make sure that your IDE would find the location of the program. For this part, I will show you how I execute the program in **Visual Studio Code** IDE.

**1.**
Make sure that your explorer in **Visual Studio Code** shows the location of where you put the downloaded program. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79844632/164130587-42c218ec-2ce8-431b-b63f-d93aadb5a095.png)
